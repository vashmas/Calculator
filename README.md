I built this modern animated calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main goal of this project was to practice front-end development and create something that is not only functional but also visually attractive.

This calculator has a clean design with smooth animations and interactive buttons, which makes it easy and fun to use.

🔹 Clean & Organized Code
Structured and beginner-friendly code written in separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
